ULISBOA at SemEval-2017 Task 12: Extraction and classification of temporal expressions and events

Source code for our approach to participate on SemEval 2017 Task 12: Clinical TempEval challenge, using [IBEnt](http://github.com/AndreLamurias/IBEnt), a framework to identify biomedical entities based on machine learning and semantic techniques, to identify the text spans of time and event entities and hand-crafted rules to assign attributes to each entity.
